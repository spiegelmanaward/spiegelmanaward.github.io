## Chairing the Spiegelman Award Committee

Congratulations former winner of the Spiegelman Award! If you won the award 3 years ago you are the chair of the Spiegelman Award Committee. This is a brief attempt to help you in your duties. This is not official guidance, rather it is informal information passed down from previous chairs. 

When you are chairing the Spiegelman Award Committee you have several responsibilities:

1. Update the Spiegelman Award Website 
2. Make sure the Spiegelman Award Nomination is Advertised
3. Gather nominations for the Spiegelman Award
4. Organize the Award Committee for scoring of nominations
5. Organize an Award Committee Meeting for discussing nominations
6. Notifying the Awardee and those who did not win
7. Updating the Spiegelman Award Website with the Awardee's name

## How to update this website

The first thing you'll want to do is update this website. You will want to do this in January of the nomination year. You want to update the nomination date https://www.spiegelmanaward.org/. It is currently set to June 1, but in a lot of the APHA nomination materials the date is May 1. You can make this decision and confirm it with the APHA then update the website. 

To update this website: 

0. Install the [postcards package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/postcards/index.html)
1. Open `index.Rmd` in Rstudio
2. Search for "mailto" in `index.Rmd` to change the email address if you want to receive applications to a different email address then the gmail [see below}
3. Knit the file
4. Push your changes to Github!

## Make sure the Spiegelman Award is Advertised

Starting in January you will want to: 

1. Post the Spiegelman Award Website and nomination form to social media
2. Post the Spiegelman Award Website to various societies journals/websites including APHA.
3. Email Department Chairs to suggest that they nominate potential candidates
4. Organize the committee to reach out to particular chairs of candidates they are aware of


## Gather Nominations

The current process is to create a new email address for nominations each year. For example, in 2024, we had the nominations going to the email address spiegelman.nomination2024@gmail.com. This avoids previous issues in trying to pass an email address to new chairs from year to year. You can use gmail to set up forwarding of this email to your work/personal email. 

**Caution** In past years, some of the nomination forms did not get forwarded from the gmail address and were, in fact, stuck in the spam folder of the Gmail address. Make sure you check the spam folder after the deadline to ensure you didn't miss any nominations!!!

In past years, we have taken the nomination materials and placed them in a Google Drive or DropBox folder, one subfolder per nomination. This folder can then be shared with the committee members. Alternatively, PDF packets can be emailed to committee members.

## Organize the scoring 

For the past few years we have used a scoring sheet like this one: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQ9saGru8iEsli__9qr66sCNug557KPFEC0-KxJiUkg/edit?usp=sharing

Which allows for scoring candidates on 4 subcategories: 

1. __Methods__	Contribute methodological work that has an important impact on public health or other health fields				
2. __Engagement__	Engage actively in the application of statistics/biostatistics to public health (broadly defined)				
3. __Demonstration__	Demonstrate the critical role and value of statistical reasoning in public health				
4. __Professional Services__	Professional services (broadly defined), with national services generally weighted more than local services

Each candidate is scored on all four categories using the scale: 

1. Good
2. Very Good
3. Excellent

Conflicts are annotated and typically we calculate scores with and without conflicts to see if there are serious descrepancies that should be addressed during the committee meeting. For major conflicts where a committee member would not feel comfortable scoring a candidate, which has come up, they should discuss this with the committee chair.

## Organize the commitee meeting

We typically organize one committee meeting to evaluate once the scores are complete. This usually happens in June or July. 

## Notify the Awardee

When you have decided on an Awardee, the tradition has been to email or call the awardee and let the nominator of the awardee know as well. It ia also important to reach out to the nominators of all the other candidates and let them know that their nominee was not selected. It is a ton of work for the nominees to put these in, so be sure to thank nominators for their effort as well! 

## Update the Spiegelman Award Website

Use the instructions above and be sure to add the new Spiegelman Awardee to the end of the website. 


## Update these instructions

This was a quick jotting down of information from a previous chair. Please feel free to augment/edit/expand in the future!
